	<h1>Vulkan Renderer</h1>
	<h3>About</h3>
	<p>
	A small renderer I did during the summer using the VulkanSDK. It's my first
	attempt using vulkan so it's really unpolished.
	</p>
	<p>
	I implemented shadows and bloom. The leaves in the tree have masked opacity
	(the implementation is not as performant as it could be).
	</p>
	<img src="./data/vulkan0.jpg" alt="vulkan0_img">
	<p>
	I also implemented basic animations.
	</p>

	<p>
	There is also parenting, serialization and a small editor. I thought it would
	be cool to make a small game in the future.
