	<p>
	The objective of the project wasn't creating a fun game, but rather tackle
	the workflow used for publishing a mobile game in the Play Store. It even
	contains ads (I personally dislike ads, but this was for learning purposes
	and I'm not expecting to make a single cent out of it).

	<h3>Team</h3>
	<p>
	<span>Programmers:</span> Pablo Marcos, Ignacio Mendezona
	<br>
	<span>Artists:</span> Me
	</p>
	<h3>Contribution</h3>
	<p>
	I programed the player movement, items, effects, menus, score, sounds, ui,
	integrated the ads and uploaded the game to the Play Store (it's in revision
	right now). I don't remember if the AI used is the one I programmed or the
	one my teammate did.
